# Metal Classification Model



## Description

This project contains the illustration of how the model works on a simple web page using Flask; a python framework. The app has been deployed on Render, a unified cloud platform used for building and running all types of apps and websites. On the web page, one will be able to upload the image and submit by clicking the button available on the page. After that the image is fed into the trained model and gives the output or the prediction. The project also contains a jupiter notebook file that shows steps followed in trainining the data used on the web page which is found in `model` folder. 

Note: Deployed version of the web pages [Here](https://metal-classification-vsk4.onrender.com/)
